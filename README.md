## What is an API gateway?
An API gateway provides a single point of entry for clients or service consumers to access back-end services. An API gateway accepts calls from client applications and forwards them to the appropriate services. As a central point of control between clients and services, an API gateway can be used to implement rate limiting, security, load balancing, routing, and monitoring. It also helps to enforce loose coupling, security, scalability, and high availability.  

An API gateway provides a mechanism through which the user interface components of an application can connect to back-end services to exchange data. This article introduces the concept of an API gateway, discusses the differences between an API gateway and a reverse proxy, and illustrates how you can implement an API gateway using YARP (Yet Another Reverse Proxy) in ASP.NET Core  

An API gateway is a special kind of reverse proxy. A reverse proxy is a server that sits between clients and back-end services to distribute the client requests across multiple machines. A reverse proxy is a good choice for caching, security, and load balancing. The clients can call the downstream services only through the reverse proxy, which forwards the requests to the appropriate downstream service.
